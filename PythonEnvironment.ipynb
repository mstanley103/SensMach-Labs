    "# Creating the Python Environment<a class=\"tocSkip\">\n",
    "&copy; 2020 by Michael Stanley (Mike.Stanley@ieee.org)<BR>\n",
    "Last revised: 16 July 2020\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Anaconda gives you the ability to create and maintain multiple \"environments\" for Python and R development.  Each environment can be thought of as a combination of specific versions of those languages and various libraries.  Getting a self-consistent and working combination of the various dependencies can be a lot of work, and Anaconda provides several ways to snapshot and share these environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook tells you how to:\n",
    "1. Install Anaconda itself (actually, we'll point you to Anaconda's installation instructions)\n",
    "2. Easily replicate the course environment using the Anaconda \"conda env create\" command\n",
    "3. Alternately, create the environment from scratch if needed\n",
    "\n",
    "Before proceeding, review [Managing environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Anaconda\n",
    "This is easy.  Simply download and install Anaconda using the Download button at https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Replicate the environment\n",
    "Once Anaconda has been installed:\n",
    "1.\tFrom the Windows Start menu, open up an Anaconda prompt.\n",
    "2.\tcopy Jupyter/environment.yml into the directory indicated by the Anaconda prompt\n",
    "3.\tat the Anaconda prompt, type: conda env create –f [environment.yml](environment.yml)\n",
    "4.\tOnce that step completes, type: conda activate training\n",
    "5.\tFinally: jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create the environment from scratch\n",
    "    \n",
    "### From scratch phase 1\n",
    "1. From the Windows Start menu, open up an Anaconda prompt.\n",
    "2. conda create --name training\n",
    "3. conda activate training\n",
    "4. conda install python=3.7.6\n",
    "5. conda install -c anaconda ipykernel\n",
    "6. pip install jupyter\n",
    "7. jupyter notebook\n",
    "8. Navigate to this notebook and execute the next cell\n",
    "    \n",
    "### From scratch phase 2\n",
    "The next cell installs a number of required libraries using the standard \"pip\" installer"

    "The pyaudio library is used by the [Integration-Sound](Integration-Sound.ipynb) data collection tool.  Unfortunately we've hit a number of problems using pip to install it.
