       "\tThis application is intended to enable you to capture sensor data from an embedded development board which connects\n",
       "\tto your PC via a serial port interface.  Unlike most data logger applications to date, this application runs completely in\n",
       "\tyour browser.  That is, it executes on the client side of the PC-web interface.  It is written completely in HTML5/CSS/Javascript.\n",
       "\tThis offers a number of advantages (a single server can support many users) but does mean that you have to keep captured data in\n",
       "\tmemory until you explicitly download a data file to your PC.  This limits the length of the logging session to the memory available\n",
       "\tto your browser.  For academic settings, this will rarely be a limitation.\n",
       "\t<p>This implementation was purposely keep relatively simple so that students might easily understand the source code and adapt\n",

       "\t<h2>Prerequisites</h2>\n",
       "\t<p>In order to use this logger, you must have enabled your browser's Experimental Web Platform Features. \n",

       "\t<p>The web serial API enables the browser to communicate with serial ports on your PC.  This application lets you communicate\n",
       "\twith embedded sensor boards which stream sensor readings in textual comma separated form (csv) over to your PC.  This is not the\n",
       "\tmost efficient method for conveying data, but it has the advantage of being simple and human readable.  You must have installed a \n",
       "\tcompanion app to your embedded board for this to work properly.  The only hard requirement on that companion app is that it stream data\n",
       "\tin CSV format.  Whatever is streamed will be collected into your log file (after being prepended with sample numbers).\n",
       "    <p>This application also makes use of the Native File System API for storing files on your PC.  Again, you may have to explicitly\n",
