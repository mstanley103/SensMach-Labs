    "# Introduction\n",
    "This notebook uses a number of Python libraries to implement a simple interface for capturing sensor information\n",
    "from a Raspberry Pi.    Graphics are provided using the bqplot library, and GUI widgets are created\n",
    "using the standard ipywidgets library.  Communication to the Pi is via a simple streaming socket interface.\n",
    "    \n",
    "This notebook is intended both as proof of concept and as a teaching aide.  It is NOT intended for production use in collecting sensor data.  In that case, a non-Jupyter implemention makes more sense.  Please use the notebook in the spirit in which it is intended.\n",
    "    \n",
    "This draft of the Notebook is intended to work in conjunction with a standard Raspberry Pi (RPi 3 Model B used for development) coupled with an RPi Sense Hat.\n",
