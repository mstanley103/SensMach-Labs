	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	This application is intended to enable you to capture sensor data from an embedded development board which connects
	to your PC via a serial port interface.  Unlike most data logger applications to date, this application runs completely in
	your browser.  That is, it executes on the client side of the PC-web interface.  It is written completely in HTML5/CSS/Javascript.
	This offers a number of advantages (a single server can support many users) but does mean that you have to keep captured data in
	memory until you explicitly download a data file to your PC.  This limits the length of the logging session to the memory available
	to your browser.  For academic settings, this will rarely be a limitation.
	<p>This implementation was purposely keep relatively simple so that students might easily understand the source code and adapt
	it for their use.
	<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
	<p>In order to use this logger, you must have enabled your browser's Experimental Web Platform Features. 
	If you haven't already done that, copy and paste the appropriate link below to your browser's URL field, then enable those features in
	the resulting screen.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features
		<li>opera://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features
		<li>edge://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features
	</ul>
	<p>The web serial API enables the browser to communicate with serial ports on your PC.  This application lets you communicate
	with embedded sensor boards which stream sensor readings in textual comma separated form (csv) over to your PC.  This is not the
	most efficient method for conveying data, but it has the advantage of being simple and human readable.  You must have installed a 
	companion app to your embedded board for this to work properly.  The only hard requirement on that companion app is that it stream data
	in CSV format.  Whatever is streamed will be collected into your log file (after being prepended with sample numbers).
    <p>This application also makes use of the Native File System API for storing files on your PC.  Again, you may have to explicitly
	enable these features as was done for the web serial API.
    <h2>Controls</h2>
	<h3>Select your baud rate</h3>
	<label for="baudrate">Port speed:</label>
	<select name="baudrate" id="baudrate">
	  <option value=9600>9,600 bit/s</option>
	  <option value=19200>19,200 bit/s</option>
	  <option value=38400>38,400 bit/s</option>
	  <option value=57600>57,600 bit/s</option>
	  <option value=115200>115,200 bit/s</option>
	  <option value=230400>230,400 bit/s</option>
	</select><br>
	This application supports a number of possible serial port baud rates.  Select the value which matches your embedded code implementation.
	<h3>Connecting to your board</h3>
	<button id="connect-to-serial">Connect to board</button>
	<p>Clicking this button brings up a selector (see figure) showing the various serial port devices
	connected to your PC.  Select the port which corresponds to your development board and click 'Connect'.
	At that point, the serial port will be opened and the "Capture data stream" checkbox will be enabled.<BR>
	<img src="images/PortSelector.png">
	<h3>Starting &amp; stoping logging</h3>
	<input type="checkbox" id="logEnable" name="logEnable" disabled=true)>
	<label for="logEnable"> Capture data stream</label>
	<p>Check this control to start collecting data from the serial port.  Data
	is stored (and added to over time) in an internal variable in your browser.  When you uncheck the checkbox, you will stop accumulating
	new records.  Once you uncheck the control, stored records will be shown in the logger console.  Data is not saved to disk until you
	click the SaveAs button described below.  If you recheck the checkbox, prior data is cleared out before you begin to 
	accumulate new data records.
	<h3>Clear console</h3>
	<button id="cls" onclick='clearConsole()'>Clear Console</button><p>Click this button to clear the console.  This button does NOT clear the
	internal record store, which is still available for download.
	<h3>Download collected data</h3>
	<button id="save-data">SaveAs</button>
	<p>Click this button to initiate a download of saved records to the filename selected
	in the resulting file browser.
	<h3>Sending commands to your development board</h3>
    <input type="text" id="message-input" >
    <button type="submit" id="submit-button" >Send command to board</button>
	<p>Use these controls to send a message to your embedded board.  For the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense companion
	application, this would be digits 0 through 7, which simply set the color of the on-board tricolor LED.  Command value '8' is reserved for 
	keep-alive packets that are periodically sent to the board to keep the serial port channel active.
	<h2>For more information...</h2>
	As mentioned, this application is dependent upon the experimental Web Serial API interface.  The following resources will get
